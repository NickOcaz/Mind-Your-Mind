### Cooperation with A.I.
A.I. will be utilized throughout this project's development to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and innovation and also implemented if required to identify bugs and code optimization. Any suggestion provided by A.I. will be questioned for an explanation to gain a deeper understanding and learn from the offered information. All information obtained via A.I. has been scrutinized and cross-referenced to ensure its validity.

#### A.I. Introduction for software development

A.I. helps identify and fix bugs faster, improving the overall quality of the software. Additionally, AI-driven tools can analyze vast amounts of data to provide insights, optimize code, and predict potential issues, leading to more robust and scalable applications. Embracing AI in software development not only accelerates the development process but also opens up new possibilities for innovation and problem-solving.

#### A.I. Goals

- Incorporate A.I. as a partnership in the development of this project.
- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Explore ideas with A.I. to assist in generating a theme and imagery.
- Image Creation.
- Suggestions for research.
- Bug fixing and optimization.

## Using A.I. for research and image creation.

### Co Pilot utilized for:

- Generating Topics for Mental Health.
- Asking Copilot for ways to combat mental health issues.
- Refined requests for more detailed and specific suggestions.
- Image Creation.
- Requested high-quality cartoon-style images to represent different mental health-related activities.
- Provided feedback to refine the style and specificity of the images.
- Adjusted the request to get comic-style illustrations without a superhero theme.
- Being Specific for Best Results.
- Clarified and adjusted image styles (from cartoon to caricature to comic).
- Ensured descriptions were precise to get the desired quality and tone.
- Iterated through multiple generations to perfect the visuals.

By specifying my needs and providing clear questions, I was able to harness Copilotâ€™s capabilities effectively, resulting in suitable material.

## Using A.I. for application creation.

### Co Pilot utilized for:

- Streamlining tasks and saving valuable time. Its implementation was focused on enhancing efficiency and productivity without replacing the essential human touch and creativity.
- Bootstrap Navigation Bar.
- Request to create a responsive Bootstrap navigation bar.
- Request to add dropdown menus within the navigation bar.
- Adding Lists.
- Request to add an unordered list to cards.
- Bootstrap form.
- Request to add input validation to the form fields.
- Modals pop-up with feedback when form complete.

## Using A.I. for problem solving / bug fixes.
### Co Pilot utilized for:
When encountering an issue centering inline items, I turned to Copilot for assistance. While initial attempts to correct the code didn't fully solve the alignment issue, Copilot identified an unclosed div tag that might have been missed otherwise. This discovery not only highlighted the importance of attention to detail in coding but also demonstrated how AI can aid in debugging and improving code efficiency.

As Co Pilot is installed on VSCode it was easily accessible when issues occurred. Before making my final deployment I have asked Co Pilot to check through the code and it was unable to identify any obvious issues.

### Deployment

Here's how to set up a GitHub repository using the Code Institute Template, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are included when opening within the Gitpod IDE:

- Login to GitHub: Log in to your GitHub profile.
- Navigate to Template: Go to the Code Institute Full Template.
- Create New Repository: Click the dropdown for 'Use this template' and select "Create a new repository".
- Name and Describe: Provide the necessary name and description for your repository, then click 'Create repository from template'.
- Now able to open in VSCode that now gives access to the repository.
- Work in Gitpod: You can now work on your repository within the Code Institute Gitpod IDE workspace.

Early Deployment: Once the project repository is created, perform an early deployment for the live project. This allows for early and continuous testing using various devices, as well as utilizing Dev Tools available within browsers.

#### Bugs

- BUG - Initially there was a conflict between a flexbox and Bootstrap grid within the hero section.
- RESOLVED - Due to the time constraints of this project it was more convenient to rewrite the grid solely with Bootstrap. This fixed the bug.
